# TODO App using Nimbus SDUI
This is a sample project created for showing developers how to use [Nimbus](https://github.com/ZupIT/nimbus) to build their server driven screens. 
This is not fully implemented yet and as soon as it is, we'll use it to write a tutorial for Nimbus SwiftUI and Nimbus Compose.

# Running the backend server
You need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed for running the backend.

In the folder `backend`, run:
```
npm run start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

# Running the Android App
Open the folder `compose` with Android Studio and press the button to run the project.

# Running the iOS App
Open the project inside `swift-ui` with XCode and press the button to run the project.

# Current status of the implementation

## iOS
